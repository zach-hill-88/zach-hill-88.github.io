<p>Tacoma Public Schools are so great that there is a waitlist to enroll your child. <br> <br> Many high profile individuals from around the country,
    and even the world, have signed up to enroll their children. <br>  <br> Click the buttons below to add your name to the waitlist, or view the current waitlist. <br><br>
    If you get impatient with waiting, we have added a new feature which allows you to remove others from the waitlist, improving your child's chances of attending. <br><br>
    You can access this feature by clicking the button that says "Remove from the Waitlist."

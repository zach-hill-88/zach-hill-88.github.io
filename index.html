    <h1>Web Programming - EME 6930</h1>
    <h2>Zach Hill</h2>
    <p>I am a graduate student beginning my fourth semester in USF's  M.S. Learning Design and Technology Program. I have been working as an ESL teacher for six years, both in Hawai`i and Colombia. My hobbies include making and listening to music, learning new languages, and exploring the Great Outdoors. 
        On this site, you can find some of the work that I will be completing in Dr. Smith's Web Programming course.</p>
